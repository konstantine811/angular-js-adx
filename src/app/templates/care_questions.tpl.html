              You will receive your test results in a clear, electronic report.  It is up to you if you receive these results with a genetic counselor or on your own.  However, if you have additional questions about what these results mean to you or your family, our genetics counselors will still be available to discuss your results with you, for no additional charge.  We want to be sure you are getting the most from your Alzheimer’s ApoE Genetic Test and understand your results.

              Genetics is only one part of your risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease. While learning that you have an increased risk of developing a disease can be unsettling, there is also power in obtaining that knowledge.  Sometimes we find ourselves questioning if we would have made a choice earlier in life if we had know the outcome long-term.  Knowing that you have an increased genetic risk for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease may empower you to take measured action to live a cognitively healthy life in order to best protect your future self.

                Having the ApoE-e4 variant means that you have an increased genetic risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. This does not mean, however, that you will definitely develop Alzheimer's disease. Learning your genetic risk can help you take measured steps toward improving your cognitive health, so you can reduce your risk for or delay the onset of Alzheimer’s disease. Sometimes making lifestyle changes can be hard, but having a reason for why you are eating healthier, reducing your stress, and making fitness and sleep a priority can be motivating.

              Stress management, nutrition, fitness, social engagement, ongoing brain training (music, games, reading, crafts, etc), and avoiding environmental toxins may improve your cognitive health. Living an overall healthier life may also help reduce your risk for or delay the onset of late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
