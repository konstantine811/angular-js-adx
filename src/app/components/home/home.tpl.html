                  Changes begin happening in the brain about two decades before the first symptoms of memory decline. Your lifestyle, environment, and other medical conditions, along with your genetics and age influence your cognitive health. Don’t wait until your memory begins to fade. Find out your genetic risk for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease early, so you have the time to consider your options and make lifestyle changes that feel right for you. For individuals at high risk for Alzheimer’s disease, early action can make a difference.

                  The Alzheimer’s ApoE test is a single gene test that looks at your ApoE-related genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease. In addition to genetics, your Alzheimer’s disease risk is also influenced by your  other medical conditions, age, gender, and environmental and lifestyle factors.
                  <div class="txt--indent">
                    ApoE comes in three forms: ApoE-e2, ApoE-e3, and ApoE-e4. Our Alzheimer’s ApoE genetic test combines your ApoE - related genetics with your age to help assess your Alzheimer’s disease risk. Other factors such as gender, medical health and lifestyle habits also influence your Alzheimer’s disease risk. We do not take these factors into your genetics risk.  Identifying your overall risk can help you decide how aggressively you want to address your cognitive health.
