These malfunctions are the result of damage to or changes in the brain. Together your genetics, other medical conditions, and lifestyle and environmental factors influence your brain health and function, and are thus associated with your risk of developing dementia.</p>

                        When people discuss Alzheimer’s disease, they usually divide it into two classifications: early-onset Alzheimer’s disease and late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, with a subtype of early-onset called early-onset Familial Alzheimer’s disease (eFAD).
                      </p>
                      <p class="txt txt-black txt--indent-small">
                        Neurologists believe that early-onset Alzheimer’s disease and late-onset Alzheimer’s disease function similarly, but are differentiated by age of onset. Early-onset Alzheimer’s disease is when symptoms occur before age 65 and late-onset Alzheimer’s disease is when symptoms begin at age 65 and older.
                      </p>
                      <p class="txt txt-black txt--indent-small">
                        Early-onset Alzheimer’s disease is uncommon and only accounts for about 5-10% of all Alzheimer’s disease cases. eFAD is a rare subgroup of early-onset Alzheimer’s disease. eFAD is known to be linked to genetics and accounts for only about 1% of all cases of Alzheimer’s disease. The three known genes that cause eFAD are: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin-1 (PS1), and presenilin-2 (PS2).

                        Late-onset Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of Alzheimer’s  disease, with symptoms appearing on or after age 65.  Genetics is a risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, but not everyone who carries the ApoE-e4 gene will develop late-onset Alzheimer’s disease and some of the people with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease do not have a copy of ApoE-e4.

                      Research indicates that lifestyle behaviors across your life span may contribute to the development of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease. Also, changes occur in the brain up to two decades before the first symptoms develop. Because late-onset Alzheimer's disease is believed to be caused by a combination of environmental, genetic, medical, and lifestyle factors, learning your genetic risk can help you determine how aggressively you need to make lifestyle changes to reduce your risk. The earlier in your life that you commit to living a cognitively healthy lifestyle, the more you can reduce your risk for or delay the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease.

Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) indicate that the e4 allele of ApoE is the strongest single genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease.<a class="references-number-highlight" ng-click="refScroll($event, 'RS1')"><sup>1,2</sup></a>  Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a protein that is involved in the metabolism of fats in your body and injury repair in your brain.3 ApoE is associated with both cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer’s disease risk.<a class="references-number-highlight" ng-click="refScroll($event, 'RS1')"><sup>4</sup></a>  Researchers have identified that ApoE plays a role in Aβ (amyloid-beta) aggregation and clearance in the brain, synaptic plasticity, neuroinflammation, glucose metabolism, neuronal signaling, and mitochondrial function.4 ApoE also mediates cholesterol metabolism, with the ApoE-e4 allele associated with both hyperlipidaemia and hypercholesterolaemia, which can lead to atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease and stroke.<a class="references-number-highlight" ng-click="refScroll($event, 'RS1')"><sup>5,6</sup></a>

You cannot change your genetics and your risk for Alzheimer’s disease increases as you age, but there is hope in the fight against Alzheimer’s.  Learning your genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease before symptoms of memory loss begin helps inform you how aggressively you want to address your modifiable lifestyle factors to optimize your cognitive health.

                      Once Helix laboratories have analyzed your saliva sample and sequenced your DNA, they identify your SNP’s specific to the ApoE test (rs429358 and rs7412). This information is then transferred to ADx Healthcare and interpreted to develop your personalized Alzheimer’s ApoE Genetic Test report.

                    <p class="txt txt-black">The Alzheimer’s ApoE test is a single gene test that looks at your genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease. Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) indicate that the e4 allele of ApoE is the strongest single genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease.<a class="references-number-highlight" ng-click="refScroll($event, 'RS1')"><sup>1,2</sup></a>  Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a protein that is involved in the metabolism of fats in your body and injury repair in your brain.3 ApoE is associated with both cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer’s disease risk.<a class="references-number-highlight" ng-click="refScroll($event, 'RS1')"><sup>4</sup></a>  Researchers have identified that ApoE plays a role in Aβ (amyloid-beta) aggregation and clearance in the brain, synaptic plasticity, neuroinflammation, glucose metabolism, neuronal signaling, and mitochondrial function.4 ApoE also mediates cholesterol metabolism, with the ApoE-e4 allele associated with both hyperlipidaemia and hypercholesterolaemia, which can lead to atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease and stroke.<a class="references-number-highlight" ng-click="refScroll($event, 'RS1')"><sup>5,6</sup></a>

                        Alzheimer's disease is influenced by genetics, environment, lifestyle, and other medical factors.<a class="references-number-highlight" ng-click="refScroll($event, 'RS1')"><sup>7-16</sup></a>  Thus, having the high risk copy of this gene (ApoE-e4) does not guarantee that you will develop Alzheimer's disease and not possessing a copy of the highest risk allele (APOE e4) does not mean you won't ever develop Alzheimer's disease. You cannot change your genetics and your risk for Alzheimer’s disease increases as you age, but there is hope in the fight against Alzheimer’s.  Learning your genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease before symptoms of memory loss begin helps inform you how aggressively you want to address your modifiable lifestyle factors to optimize your cognitive health.
