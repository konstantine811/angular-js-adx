                                                GINA was signed into law in the United States in 2008 to protect against discrimination based on genetic information by employers and health insurance companies for employment and coverage issues. You should be careful about sharing your Genetic Information with others as Genetic Information that you share with others could be used against your interests. In addition, GINA does not protect against discrimination by, for example, long-term health, life, and disability insurance providers, or the military. Some, but not all, states and other jurisdictions have laws that protect individuals with regard to their Genetic Information. You may want to consult a lawyer to understand the extent of legal protection of your Genetic Information before you share it with anybody.

Genetic Information that you share with family, friends or employers may also be used against your interests. Even if you share Genetic Information that has limited or no meaning today, that information could have greater meaning in the future as new discoveries are made. In addition, if you are asked by an insurance company whether you have learned Genetic Information about your health conditions and you do not disclose this to them, this may be considered to be fraud.
