ADx Healthcare Services include test services and reporting for genetic testing. Results of your genetic test are based on saliva samples and/or Genetic Information that you provide, and the results are reported to you through the ADx Healthcare website. ADx Healthcare requires physician authorization for each test and provides you with the option for genetic counseling as part of our Services. Once a test is authorized by a physician, a sample collection kit will be mailed to you by ADx Healthcare or its partner for self-collection of your saliva sample. After collecting the sample, you will mail the kit back to the laboratory where your sample will be processed and analyzed. A copy of your results will be made available to the ordering physician. You can choose to review your results, via phone, with a genetic counselor.

                                                GINA was signed into law in the United States in 2008 to protect against discrimination based on genetic information by employers and health insurance companies for employment and coverage issues. You should be careful about sharing your Genetic Information with others as Genetic Information that you share with others could be used against your interests. In addition, GINA does not protect against discrimination by, for example, long-term health, life, and disability insurance providers, or the military. Some, but not all, states and other jurisdictions have laws that protect individuals with regard to their Genetic Information. You may want to consult a lawyer to understand the extent of legal protection of your Genetic Information before you share it with anybody.

Genetic Information that you share with family, friends or employers may also be used against your interests. Even if you share Genetic Information that has limited or no meaning today, that information could have greater meaning in the future as new discoveries are made. In addition, if you are asked by an insurance company whether you have learned Genetic Information about your health conditions and you do not disclose this to them, this may be considered to be fraud.
