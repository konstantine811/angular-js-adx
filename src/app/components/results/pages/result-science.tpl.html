          ApoE comes in three forms: ApoE-e2, ApoE-e3, and ApoE-e4.  Having a high risk copy of this gene (ApoE-e4) does not guarantee that you will develop Alzheimer’s disease. Likewise, possessing a copy of the lowest risk variant (ApoE-e2) does not mean you won’t develop Alzheimer’s disease.  Learning your ApoE -related genetic risk can be paired with your age, gender, medical health and lifestyle habits to help assess your Alzheimer’s disease risk. Knowing your overall risk can help you decide how aggressively you want to address your cognitive health. Visit Genetics Home Reference to learn more about ApoE.

              Inside the nucleus of each cell in the human body is a complex code of instructions for forming and sustaining life, called your genes. Each gene influences a specific trait, such as hair color. The gene is not the trait itself, but rather a factor that causes the organism to develop a specific trait.
              <div class="txt--indent">
                Your genetic instruction manual is written with 4 chemicals – A (Adenine), T (Thymine), G (Guanine), and C (Cytosine) – that are paired together (A’s paired with T’s & C’s paired with G’s) in two separate chains that are oriented in opposite directions, like the northbound and southbound lanes on a highway.  These paired combinations of chemical code live opposite one another in a long line, fitting together like adjacent puzzle pieces.  The A/T and C/G base pairs attach to a backbone and face inward, connecting like rungs of a ladder that are twisted together to form an intertwined double helix.
              </div>
              <div class="txt--indent">
                Your genome has billions of combinations of these four letters, forming 20,000 sentences that code for about 20,000 proteins. Every three letter pairs forms a new genetic “word” that codes for a building block of a protein.  The code TGA means “stop”, thus functioning as a signal to the body that this is the end of this genetic coding sentence.

                Each person has 23 chromosomes from their father and 23 from their mother, to make 23 chromosome pairs. During cell division, your DNA gets condensed into groupings called chromosomes. When cell division happens in your body, your helix divides and replicates itself, creating two double strands.

                People have about 99.9% of their genetic code in common with one another. The most common genetic variation among people can be identified by single DNA building blocks called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). For example, a SNP may replace the nucleotide adenine (A) with the nucleotide cytosine (C) in a certain stretch of DNA. There are approximately 10 million SNPs in the human genome, or one every 300 nucleotides, typically in the DNA between genes. Most SNPs have no effect on health or development, but scientists use some SNPs as biological markers to locate genes that are associated with disease.  SNPs within a gene or in a regulatory region near a gene may play a more direct role in a disease by affecting the gene’s function.
              </div>
              <div class="txt--indent">
                Genes can come in different forms, called alleles.  For example, the Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene that is associated with Alzheimer’s disease has three possible alleles – e2, e3, and e4. You have two alleles for each gene, so for ApoE there are six possible genetic combinations a person can have: e2/e2, e2/e3, e3/e3, e2/e4, e3/e4, and e4/e4. You received one allele from your mother and one from your father. If both alleles match, such as e2/e2, you are said to be homozygous. If the two alleles differ, such as e3/e4, you are said to be heterozygous for that trait.  A person who is homozygous for a genetic trait will pass along that genetic code to their offspring.  A person who is heterozygous for the ApoE e4 allele has a 50% chance of passing along that allele to their offspring.

                Each sentence in your genome is a specific gene that codes for a protein.  These proteins in your body are the building blocks of life, allowing you to breath, walk, think, eat, and more. While an error in some genes can lead directly to the development of a disease, not all diseases are determined solely by genetics.   The environment around you and your lifestyle can influence how the genome functions.  Some genes increase the risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, while other genes are protective against Alzheimer’s.  However, with diet, exercise, stress management, proper sleep, educational stimulation, and socialization you can impact how these genes are expressed.  Such that, some people who develop Alzheimer’s disease do not carry the ApoE e4 risk allele, but are believed to have developed the disease due to other factors such as possible medical comorbidities, and environmental and lifestyle factors. While you currently cannot cure Alzheimer’s disease with lifestyle changes, you may be able to slow the progression of or delay the onset of the disease, which allows individuals more cognitively healthy years and a better quality of life.

                Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) have identified common variations associated with disease. The resultant output is that when these multiple disease related genetic variants are combined together they provide a predictive ability across complex traits and diseases, called a Polygenic Risk Score (PRS).

                Precision medicine involves providing a therapeutic approach to the whole person. By analyzing your personal genetics and biochemistry, physicians can tailor preventive and therapeutic medicine that will best optimize your unique overall health.  Alzheimer’s genetic testing provides a risk measure for Alzheimer’s disease long before the usual age of symptom onset, affording individuals time to act upon environmental and lifestyle factors, as well as other medical comorbidities that influence the onset of Alzheimer’s disease.

              The ApoE test results are based on data for individuals of European descent.  If you are not of European descent, you are still expected to have a higher risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease than if you did not carry an ApoE-e4 allele. The exact percentage of risk may vary though from the percentages listed in your report. Also, non-genetic specific data demonstrates that older African Americans and Hispanics are more likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease than people of other ethnicities.

                In addition, overall more women than men develop Alzheimer’s disease.  Researchers are still unsure how much of this is because women tend to live longer than men and how much is attributable to lifestyle differences between men and women. Also, the ApoE-e4 variant is attributable to a greater percent of risk for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease in women than men.

              The association between type-2 diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease is greater in ApoE-e4 carriers.1 Also, based on results from observational studies, managing midlife hypertension may be more impactful for reducing Alzheimer’s disease risk for ApoE-e4 carriers than for non-carriers. 2,3  Thus, monitoring blood pressure and working to prevent or manage type-2 diabetes is important for all, but carries great importance for individuals who carry and ApoE-e4 allele.
