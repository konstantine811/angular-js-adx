            <p class="txt txt-black">The details of exactly how ApoE-e4 increases the risk for Alzheimer’s disease are still being worked out, but the fact that it does increase risk is well established.  This was first demonstrated over 20 years ago<a class="references-number-highlight" ng-click="refScroll($event, 'RS1')"><sup>54</sup></a> and has been confirmed in numerous studies.  ApoE genotype is the most important genetic factor for Alzheimer’s disease risk for most people (not including the rare “familial” Alzheimer’s disease genes that cause a much less common form of the disease).  Compared to the most common genotype (e3/e3), the presence of a single ApoE-e4 allele (e3/e4) increases an individual’s risk for Alzheimer’s disease about 3- to 4-fold, and the presence of two e4 alleles (e4/e4) increases the risk about 12- to 14-fold.<a class="references-number-highlight" ng-click="refScroll($event, 'RS1')"><sup>55</sup></a> In contrast to the e4 allele, the e2 allele is associated with reduced risk for Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

            <p class="txt txt-black">Some medical conditions are solely determined by genetics  (for example muscular dystrophy), and disease outcome is unavoidable. Late-onset Alzheimer’s disease risk is influenced by factors in addition to genetics, so whether or not you carry the ApoE-e4 genetic variant does not tell the entire story for your Alzheimer’s disease risk.  Because a combination of genetic, medical, lifestyle, and environmental factors influence Alzheimer’s disease, people with the ApoE-e4 genetic variant do not always develop Alzheimer’s disease during their lifespan, and some people who develop Alzheimer’s disease do not carry the ApoE-e4 variant.  While your ApoE genotype is not a sole determinant of disease outcome, learning your genetic risk may help you decide on measured action to reduce your risk in other ways.</p>
