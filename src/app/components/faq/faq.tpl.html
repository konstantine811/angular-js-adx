                                        Genetics is only one part of your risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease. For many people, it can be hard to be motivated to exercise.  For others, nutrition is a struggle with busy work and family schedules.  For yet others, sleep is often viewed as an inconvenience and not given much priority. Finally, stress management is an issue for many, as approximately 55% of Americans reported not even taking all their paid vacation days. (source: http://www.projecttimeoff.com/research/state-american-vacation-2016).  Knowing that you have a high genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease is unsettling, but it can help empower you to take measured action to live a cognitively healthy life in order to best protect your future self.

                                            Having the ApoE-e4 variant  (high genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease) does not guarantee you will develop late-onset Alzheimer’s disease.  Learning your genetic risk can help you take measured steps towards improving your cognitive health, so you can reduce your risk for or delay the onset of Alzheimer’s disease.  Sometimes making lifestyle changes can be hard, but having a reason for why you are eating healthier, reducing your stress, and making fitness and sleep a priority can be motivating.
