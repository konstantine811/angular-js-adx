                                        Genetics is only one part of your risk for developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
                                        Knowing that you have a high genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease is unsettling, but it can help empower you to take measured action to live a cognitively healthy life in order to best protect your future self.

                                          Having the ApoE-e4 variant means that you have an increased genetic risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. This does not mean, however, that you will definitely develop Alzheimer's disease. Learning your genetic risk can help you take measured steps towards improving your cognitive health, so you can reduce your risk for or delay the onset of Alzheimer’s disease.  Sometimes making lifestyle changes can be hard, but having a reason for why you are eating healthier, reducing your stress, and making fitness and sleep a priority can be motivating.

Living and overall healthier life may also help reduce your risk for or delay the onset of late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
