                                            Genetics is only one part of your risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease. While learning that you have a higher risk for developing a disease can be unsettling, there is also power in obtaining that knowledge.  Sometimes we find ourselves questioning if we would have made a choice earlier in life if we would have known the outcomes long-term.  Knowing that you have a high genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease is unsettling, but it can help empower you to take measured action to live a cognitively healthy life in order to best protect your future self.

                                            Having the ApoE-e4 variant  (high genetic risk for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease) does not guarantee you will develop Alzheimer’s.  Learning your genetic risk can help you take measured steps towards improving your cognitive health, so you can reduce your risk for or delay the onset of Alzheimer’s disease.  Sometimes making lifestyle changes can be hard, but having a reason for why you are eating healthier, reducing your stress, and making fitness and sleep a priority can be motivating.

                                        The Alzheimer’s APOE test is a single gene test that looks at your genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease. Having the high risk copy of this gene (APOE e4) does not guarantee that you will develop Alzheimer’s disease. Likewise, not possessing a copy of the highest risk allele (APOE e4) does not mean you won’t ever develop Alzheimer’s disease. Alzheimer’s disease is influenced by genetics, environment, and lifestyle, so learning your genetic risk helps inform you how aggressively you want to address your lifestyle to optimize your cognitive health.

                                        Your test results will explain which combination of the ApoE alleles you have. This genetic combination will be further interpreted, to help you identify your relative risk for developing late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, based on your genetics, gender and current age. Your ApoE status will not change as you age, but your chance of developing late-onset Alzheimer’s disease will increase at a different rate dependent on which ApoE combination you have. A genetic counselor will be available to go through your results with you if you have questions.

                                        Learning your genetic risk for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease can help you determine how aggressively you want to start making lifestyle changes to improve your cognitive health, such as addressing sleep habits, stress, nutrition, exercise, ongoing learning, socialization, and your exposure to chemicals and pollutants. Also, if you are identified as having an e4 allele, you may be able to enroll in clinical trials, which are research studies searching for the cure to Alzheimer’s. Enrollment gives you access to cutting edge prevention therapies and lets you participate in the search for a cure.
