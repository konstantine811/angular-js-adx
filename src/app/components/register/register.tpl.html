            <div class="txt-small txt-black txt--indent-small">
              You consent to genetic testing in our partner’s lab. Also, we may use the test results to create a report. The testing may reveal that you are at risk for a disease or condition. You may need more testing to confirm any diagnosis.  Please discuss the results with your doctor or a genetic counselor.

          <div class="txt-small txt-black txt--indent-small">
            ADx Healthcare offers genetic testing related to Alzheimer’s disease risk assessment.  Understanding your genetic risk for a disease such as Alzheimer’s disease can benefit you as you learn more about your personal health. While you cannot change your genetic makeup having information about your genetic risk can help you make decisions about your health that research indicates can have a positive impact on your cognitive health.

          <h6 class="txt-medium txt-blue-dark txt--indent-small">Genetic Conditions</h6>
          <div class="txt-small txt-black txt--indent-small">
            You may have a genetic condition even though the test results for that condition are negative.  Because of limits of technology, the test may not detect some changes in DNA or proteins that cause disease.

            <div class="txt-small txt-black">
              Once you obtain your Genetic Information, the knowledge is irrevocable. You should not assume that any information we may be able to provide to you, whether now or as genetic research advances, will be welcome. You should also understand that as research advances, in order for you to assess the meaning of your DNA in the context of such advances, you may need to obtain further services from ADx Healthcare, your physician, a genetic counselor, or other healthcare provider.
            </div>
            <div class="txt-small txt-black txt--indent-small">
              We encourage you to talk to a genetic counselor, a health professional with special training in genetic conditions, prior to collecting your sample for testing to learn more so you can make an informed decision about whether testing is right for you. A genetic counselor also can help you understand your results and options. Genetic counseling is available by phone or video conference through an independent provider network, PWNHealth. Please contact them with questions or to schedule an appointment at 888-494-7333 or gc@pwnhealth.com.
            </div>
            <div class="txt-small txt-black txt--indent-small">
              Some people feel a little anxious about getting genetic health results. This is normal. If you feel very anxious, you should speak to your physician or a genetic counselor prior to collecting your sample for testing.
            </div>
            <div class="txt-small txt-black txt--indent-small">
              Genetic research is not comprehensive. Many ethnic groups are not represented in genetic studies. Because interpretations provided in our service rely on these published studies, some interpretations may not apply to you. Future scientific research may change the interpretation of your DNA as the scientific community may show previous research to be incomplete or inaccurate. Currently, there is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease and the origin or disease pathology is not well understood.
            </div>
            <div class="txt-small txt-black txt--indent-small">
              For most common diseases, the genes we know about are only responsible for a small fraction of the risk. There may be unknown genes, environmental factors, or lifestyle choices that are far more important predictors. If your data indicate that you are not at elevated genetic risk for a particular disease or condition, you should not feel that you are protected. The opposite is also true; if your data indicate you are at an elevated genetic risk for a particular disease or condition, it does not mean you will definitely develop the disease or condition. In other words, individuals whose genetic results show they are not at increased risk to develop Alzheimer’s disease may, at some point in their lives, still develop Alzheimer’s disease. Individuals whose genetic results show they are at increased risk to develop Alzheimer’s disease may not develop the disease in their lifetime.

          <h6 class="txt-medium txt-blue-dark txt--indent-small">Genetic Information Non-Disclosure Act (GINA)</h6>
          <div class="txt-small txt-black txt--indent-small">
            GINA was signed into law in the United States in 2008 to protect against discrimination based on genetic information by employers and health insurance companies for employment and coverage issues. You should be careful about sharing your Genetic Information with others as Genetic Information that you share with others could be used against your interests. In addition, GINA does not protect against discrimination by, for example, long-term health, life, and disability insurance providers, or the military. Some, but not all, states and other jurisdictions have laws that protect individuals with regard to their Genetic Information. You may want to consult a lawyer to understand the extent of legal protection of your Genetic Information before you share it with anybody.
          </div>
          <div class="txt-small txt-black txt--indent-small">
            Genetic Information that you choose to share with your physician or other healthcare provider may become part of your medical record and through that route may be accessible to other healthcare providers and/or insurance companies in the future. Genetic Information that you share with family, friends or employers may also be used against your interests. Even if you share Genetic Information that has limited or no meaning today, that information could have greater meaning in the future as new discoveries are made. In addition, if you are asked by an insurance company whether you have learned Genetic Information about your health conditions and you do not disclose this to them, this may be considered to be fraud.

          <h6 class="txt-medium txt-blue-dark txt--indent-small">Approval and Counsel</h6>
          <div class="txt-small txt-black txt--indent-small">
            A licensed health care provider must approve this testing. You must provide accurate information when ordering this test. The health information you provide and your results will be shared with the independent provider network, PWNHealth, including its physicians, genetic counselors and other personnel providing services to you in connection with this test request. Genetic testing is complex and may show something not normal in the results. Because of this, we will provide a genetic counselor to discuss your results with you. Also, we will answer any other questions you have about the results. Also, the results will not be released to other parties without your written consent or as allowed or required by law. Genetic testing is by your own choice. For clarity, genetic counseling is available after you receive your genetic test results. The process is as follows: 1) you order your test; 2) a physician approves or denies the test; 3) if test is approved, a collection kit is mailed to you; 4) you provide a saliva specimen and return the specimen to the lab; 5) the lab processes and reports to the physician your test results; 6) the results are released to you via an email notice that will direct you to a web portal on the ADx Healthcare site.  The timeframe from test order to receipt of results is typically 4-6 weeks. If you are making a second genetic test purchase through our Helix partner, you will not have to provide an additional saliva sample. In such case, your result will be ready for you within 2-5 business days. Upon receipt of results, if you have chosen to review your results with a genetic counselor, you will receive an email with a link to schedule your phone or video genetic counseling session with PWNHealth.
