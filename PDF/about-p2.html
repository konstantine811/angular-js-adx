        The details of exactly how ApoE-e4 increases the risk for Alzheimer’s disease are still being worked out, but the fact that it does increase risk is well established.  This was first demonstrated over 20 years ago54 and has been confirmed in numerous studies.  ApoE genotype is the most important genetic factor for Alzheimer’s disease risk for most people (not including the rare “familial” Alzheimer’s disease genes that cause a much less common form of the disease).  Compared to the most common genotype (e3/e3), the presence of a single ApoE-e4 allele (e3/e4) increases an individual’s risk for Alzheimer’s disease about 3- to 4-fold, and the presence of two e4 alleles (e4/e4) increases the risk about 12- to 14-fold.55 In contrast to the e4 allele, the e2 allele is associated with reduced risk for Alzheimer’s disease.

        While some medical conditions are solely determined by genetics (for example, muscular dystrophy) and disease outcome is unavoidable, whether or not you carry the ApoE-e4 variant your genetics do not tell the entire story for your Alzheimer’s risk. Because a combination of genetic, medical, lifestyle, and environmental factors influence Alzheimer’s disease, people with the ApoE-e4 variant do not always develop Alzheimer’s disease during their lifespan, and some people who develop Alzheimer’s do not carry the ApoE-e4 variant. While your ApoE genotype is not a sole determinant of disease outcome, learning your genetic risk may help you decide on measured action to reduce your risk in other ways.

        Your genetics stay the same as you age, but your risk for Alzheimer’s disease increases with age, and it increases at different rates depending on your ApoE genotype. The table and graph below56 show approximate lifetime risk for Alzheimer’s disease at various ages based on ApoE genotype (“lifetime risk” is the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease at or before a certain age, e.g. ages 65, 75 and 85 in the charts below).  Note that these risk figures account only for ApoE genotype, without consideration of other genetic, medical or lifestyle factors that also may modify a person’s risk for Alzheimer’s disease.

The bars above your genotype show how your lifetime risk for Alzheimer’s disease increases as you age. It is important to remember that the risk levels for Alzheimer’s disease in the charts below are only based on ApoE status. The influence of other factors, such as lifestyle, environment, and other genetic variants that also contribute to risk were evaluated separately in the research studies used to develop these charts and tables.</p>
