        First, when you exercise, your muscles use glucose for fuel.  This results in lower blood glucose and insulin levels in your body. High blood glucose and insulin are risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease, so controlling them is important for brain health..

          Secondly, regular aerobic exercise reduces inflammation levels in the body, which is another important aspect of cognitive health.1,2 Aerobic exercise also stimulates the release of growth factors, which are chemicals in the brain that stimulate the growth of new blood vessels in the brain and promote the health and survival of brain cells. 1Also, aerobic exercise improves mood and sleep and reduces stress and anxiety. Depression, anxiety, stress, and poor sleep habits are all associated with increased risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease. There is no one best exercise or routine. Choose activities you enjoy and incorporate movement into everyday activities whenever possible.  However, you should check with your healthcare provider to be sure certain types and duration of activity are safe for you.

          People who do both aerobic and strength exercise have greater attention, faster information processing, and improved working memory compared to those who do aerobic exercise alone.5 For example, at the end of a 12 week strength training program, older women showed a 19% increase in cognitive capacity.6

          As you age, strength training is important to maintain the muscle mass needed for daily activities such as: standing from a seated position, opening jars, lifting grocery bags, vacuuming, and emptying the dishwasher.2,5,7  Also, bone mineral density decreases with age, which increases your risk for breaking a bone. Strength training helps to maintain or increase bone mineral density levels. This is important because each year more than more than one-third of people aged 65 or older fall, so building strong bones will protect your overall health as you age.8  To enhance cognitive health and maintain muscle strength, participate in strength training exercises at least two times per week on non-consecutive days, if your healthcare provider feels strength training is safe for you.3
