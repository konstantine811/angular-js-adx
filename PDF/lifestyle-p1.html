        As you are evaluating which lifestyle factors you want to address, remember that it is not realistic to change them all at once.  You are more likely to have lasting success implementing and maintaining behavior changes if you don’t try to change them all at once and you adjust them in small, incremental steps.  You can work with your healthcare provider to identify which of your lifestyle behaviors are the most in need of modification, as well as which are going to be the easiest for you to change.  This information can be used to develop a list of priority behaviors to change, and from there you develop small, incremental goals to get you started.

        Excessive stress can negatively impact many systems in the human body, beyond the brain, that in turn still negatively impact memory and cognition, increasing the risk for cognitive decline.  Psychological stress has been shown to raise blood cholesterol levels.3, 4 The elevation of cholesterol after a stressful event occurs within minutes of the stress exposure and can last for over 30 minutes.5 While these individual increases in cholesterol level are not large, they may contribute to atherosclerosis if they are sustained.

          The mechanisms for how stress impacts the brain were evaluated in a study where young mice were injected for seven days with a glucocorticoid similar to the body’s stress hormones (dexamethasone). Beta-amyloid protein levels in the mice’s brains increased by 60 percent, and the levels of another protein, called tau, also increased. Plaques form when beta-amyloid proteins mass together, and tau accumulation eventually leads to the formation of tangles in the brain, which are the two hallmark brain lesions of
          Alzheimer’s disease.2

          Stress is also attributed to mental health decline, which is often already a symptom of cognitive impairment and dementia.  Vulnerability, perceived coping ability, and social support interact with stressful events to determine whether a person becomes depressed. Likewise, the effects of stressful life events on mental health are buffered by feelings of control and social support.16 Hence it is imperative to provide a sense of autonomy and control, as well as provide plenty of social support to reduce the impact of stressful events on depressive symptoms.  Individuals experiencing dementia also often suffer from anxiety, especially as the condition advances from mild to moderate and severe.  Like depression, anxiety can be lessened by providing the individual with a sense of control, routine, and social support, along with relaxation exercises to assist with the anxiety itself.16

          An important component of the stress cycle is what you do to deal with the source of stress and the impacts the stressor is having on you, which is called coping. Direct coping involves trying to eliminate or change the source of the stressor.1 Stress management can come in a variety of options including relaxation techniques, behavioral changes, and support.
