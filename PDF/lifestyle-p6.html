        In addition to these specific diets, a number of individual foods and nutrients have been associated with increased and decreased risk of cognitive decline (16):

        <b>Dietary Fat:</b>
      </p>
      <p class="txt-md">
        In a study of 5386 people without dementia, eating fish had a lower risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer’s over 2 years, while eating a diet higher in total fat, saturated fat, and dietary cholesterol was associated with an increased risk of dementia (17) However, another study looking at the diets of 482 women aged 60 years and older, there was not an association between intake of saturated fat, trans fat, or dietary cholesterol and cognitive decline, but amongst those women who ate an increased amount of monounsaturated fatty acids, such as olive oil, nuts, and avocado, there was associated decrease of cognitive decline (18). Another study spanning 6.5 years  looked at the Mediterranean diet paired with consuming 1L extra virgin olive oil per week and the Mediterranean diet paired with eating 30g nuts per day compared to those assigned a low-fat diet (controls) in a total of 522 people aged 60 to 80 years.  The individuals who ate the Mediterranean diet with nuts or with olive oil had higher  cognitive test scores when compared to the controls on the low-fat diet(2). Another study following the food intake of 8,065 people aged 65 years of age and older over a period of 4 years found that regular intake of omega-3 oils and fish reduced the risk of dementia by 60%, while regular intake of omega-6 fats without regular intake of omega-3 fats increased the risk for dementia for people who do NOT have an ApoE-e4 allele (19).

        <b>Fish:</b>
      </p>
      <p class="txt-md">
        Researchers evaluating the diets of 8,065 adults aged 65 and older found that those who ate fish 2 to 3 times weekly had a reduced risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (19). Another study of 815 people ages 65 to 94 years old found that those who ate fish at least once weekly had a 60% reduced risk of Alzheimer’s disease over the study period compared to those who rarely or never ate fish. Many of the individuals with a higher total omega-3 and DHA intake also had a decreased risk of Alzheimer’s (21).

        <b>Vegetables:</b>
      </p>
      <p class="txt-md">
        Research indicates that vegetable intake is associated with Alzheimer’s risk. In a study of 3718 people 65 years of age and older, cognitive decline was slowed by 38-40% over 6 years for those consuming between 2.8 and 4.1 servings vegetables per day compared to those consuming less than 1 serving of vegetables per day. There was no association between fruit intake and cognitive function (22). In a study of 1,233 adults without dementia, vegetable intake of more than 1 cup/day reduced the risk of Mild Cognitive Impairment (23). Also, In an ongoing study of 8065 people 65 years of age and older, daily consumption of fruits and vegetables decreased the risk for all-cause dementia by 30% (19).

        A research study looking at nearly 1500 adults over the age of 60 found an increased risk of stroke and dementia among those who drank soda sweetened with artificial sweeteners. (26).
